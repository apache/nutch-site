      <description>Introduction If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, chances are you&amp;rsquo;ve seen a Nutch-based robot visiting your site while looking through your server logs. Our software obeys robots.txt files and robot META tags in HTML. These are the standard mechanisms for webmasters to tell web robots which portions of a site a robot is welcome to access.
Sysadmins/robots.txt We&amp;rsquo;re a software project, not a service, so please understand that a misbehaving crawler appearing with our Agent string is not run by us.</description>
