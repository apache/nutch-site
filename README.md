# Creating new Content

Check out the [Kube documentation](https://github.com/jeblister/kube#getting-started). Any further questions should be asked on the [Nutch dev@ mailing list](https://nutch.apache.org/community/mailing-lists/).

# Contributing

The [process is the same](https://github.com/apache/nutch?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing) as for the Nutch codebase.

# Building and Publishing the Site

To deploy a static site build execute
```
hugo --destination static_site
```

The static site is kept in this directory in the branch `asf-site` in the folder `content/` and automatically deployed onto the public Nutch website. See the [Apache Infra project website docs](https://infra.apache.org/project-site.html) and the configuration file [.asf.yaml](./asf.yaml). The branch `asf-staging` is used for deploying the staging site https://nutch.staged.apache.org/.
